## SkillUp GenAI for Software Developers Specialization

Specialization - 3 course series

In today’s fast-changing tech landscape, developers who can effectively integrate AI into their workflows are in high demand. This specialization equips experienced software professionals with practical, job-ready skills to boost productivity, streamline development, and improve code quality using tools like GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT.

Through three hands-on courses, you’ll learn how to:

-  Apply advanced prompt engineering to support AI-assisted coding, refactoring, and debugging

-  Analyze full-stack applications with AI-powered support across front-end, back-end, and database layers

-  Describe how to automate tasks such as testing, documentation, and API integration using AI tools

-  Explain how AI assists developers to design scalable development workflows for collaborative teams

Unlike generic AI courses, this program focuses on real-world software development use cases. You'll work with industry-standard tools like Visual Studio Code, explore multi-layer systems, and build projects that reflect the full software development lifecycle—from initial design to deployment.

By the end of the program, you’ll have a portfolio of AI-enhanced strategies that enhance your ability to improve team performance and deliver high-quality software at scale.

Ideal for software engineers, full-stack developers, and technical leads looking to stay ahead in a rapidly evolving industry, this specialization gives you the skills to lead the next wave of AI-enhanced development.
